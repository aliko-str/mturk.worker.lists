Lists of MTurk worker ids that either 

- were flagged as "farmer" accounts or low-quality workers (*naughtyList.txt*), or 
- completed at least one of our HITs and passed all quality checks (*niceList.txt*).

These worker ids could be used to assign qualifications to workers to either only allow trustworthy workers access your MTurk HIT (*niceList.txt*) or exclude  untrustworthy workers from accessing your HIT (*naughtyList.txt*).

Please note that the number of untrustworthy accounts (bots, farmers, users of scripts to semi-automate survey taking) is substantially larger than the one in *naughtyList.txt*, and new untrustworthy accounts appear on MTurk continuously.
